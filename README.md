# **Introduction**

This is a little guide to help you get started  to the wonderful world of glitched rando. We will go over all the set up needed and most of the tech used during a race. 

This guide is designed to players at least a bit familiar with the randomizer, if you're looking for an introduction to rando, please check out the [Small Homothety Organization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycoPpfP7nxQ&list=PL7dXvvR7OhcqYGjpJteZhZn-smJ7PZxxE&index=2) 

I still couldn't get all the videos on youtube yet, but you can check the rest of them [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14YJkQNGdjjoBTieqJ5y1WOcPZ2-hMGrE?usp=sharing) or on the hyperlinks in the titles of each chapter.

# **Mods And Settings**

Before getting in the action, we need to get some mods set up to get the glitches working properly. Open your favorite mod installer and make sure you had the following mods installed:

* Randomizer 4  
* QoL  
* Rando map Mod  
* Extra Rando and/or Unrando

## **QoL**

QoL is already a standard randomizer mod, but it has a couple extra features we want to get enabled. 

### *Faster Loads* {#faster-loads}

Open the game and go to **Options** → **Mods** and scroll to find **QoL Options**. From there enter the **Module Toggles** menu, and make sure *Faster Loads* is set to *False*. QoL’s faster loads are way too fast for out of bounds glitches and disabling that will make your experience more consistent. 

### *Module Field Toggles* {#module-field-toggles}

Enter the **QoL Mod** options following the [previous section](#faster-loads) and select *Module Field Toggles*. Scroll down to find and enabled the following options: 

* [**Storage**](#quick-map-storage-\(qms\)): will allow us to do map related glitches more than once per quit out. It’s *the most important setting* in glitched rando.  
* [**Televator**](#televator)**, [Superslides](#heading=h.p9a0e7xqpzjk), [Wall Cling Storage](#heading=h.7pmps5dq7dz5):** patch in a couple of fun specific glitches we’ll see later on.

## **Rando Map Mod**

A good portion of the glitches are map dependent so it’s convenient to have a  map from the get go. We can use *Rando Map Mod* for that\!

Every time you start a seed, remember to press ***ctrl+M*** to get your map:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-Y34SEjIw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v-Y34SEjIw) 

[Some of the glitches](#menu-storage) will require you to play the game with the map open. If you ever feel like the screen is too crowded to play, you can mitigate that by pressing ***ctrl+T*** with your map opened a couple times:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAIpIK5O8rk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAIpIK5O8rk)

## **Extra Rando | Unrando**

At the moment, there is no logic for *1.5 Glitched Rando*, so it’s played either with the *No Logic* option from *Extra Rando* or as an *Unrando* with most of the skips turned on. I’ll explain the difference, and show you how to enable both of them:

### *Extra Rando: No Logic* {#extra-rando:-no-logic}

*No Logic* is a setting that allows the seed generator to completely ignore logic constraints and place items anywhere it wants to. With glitches you’ll be able to reach a large amount of checks with little to no equipment and giving the seed the power to lock major items behind itself will allow for some fun interactions.

It’s also important to note that with *No Logic*, even with glitches, you can get a seed that is impossible (especially with non-crossroads start locations). However, I can attest by my personal experience that it is rare. At the time of writing, I’ve played around 30 glitched rando seeds and I only ever encountered 1 impossible one.

To enable *No Logic*: before beginning a new rando game, select **Connections** on the bottom left corner. If the mod is installed properly, you should see an **Extra Rando** option, select that and make sure it’s **enabled** and that **No Logic** is selected.

### *Unrando*

Unrando is a mod that handles logic not by placing items in specific places, but by randomizing the order you get the items. In a seed, your first item will be the same regardless of where you get it from. 

Even though Unrando uses traditional rando logic to check how many checks you can access at the time, playing Unrando is all about density/checks per minute. It benefits heavily from the flexibility that glitches can give you to reach new areas or fully clear others before logically available.

To enable Unrando, make sure the mod is installed and open the connections menu. Select the **Unrando** options there and enable it:

## **Debug Mod**

Glitched rando invites you to soft-lock often and a big part of the experience is  having a terrible idea to reach a check that will inevitably get you stranded in the ceiling with no way of getting down.

Even though it’s ~~usually~~ not allowed on races, it’s not a bad idea to play most of the seeds with debug on *just in case*.

## **Your First Glitched Rando Seed**

I made a code with some basic settings and seed 0 for your first seed playing with glitches. It has LifeTotems+Lore randomized starting at KP with a charm to play with [No Logic](#extra-rando:-no-logic)*.*

If you use the default settings manager, you’ll have to [configure Extra Rando manually](#extra-rando:-no-logic):

**4.1.4+207AgKWAhQPhAMXAQEBAAEA;AAAAAAAAAA==;AQAEAE13;AAAAAAAA/38=;AABuRgAAAw==;EwA=;Prh/AA==;AAACAAAAQEAAAIA/Aw==;AAAA;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA==;AQAAAAAAAAAAAA==;AAA='S2luZydzIFBhc3M=;AAAAAQ==;0**

If you use RandoSettingsManager:

**c749b5bf-2a0d-4922-861c-be7945d43a88**

If either key is expired, feel free to send me a message at @randomscorp on discord and I’ll replenish it as soon as I can.

# **The Great Glitch Library of Ramdo**

*You will now enter The Great Glitch Library of Ramdo. Behold\!*

We’ll go over the most important glitches you should know while playing, how to perform them, how they work, and some useful spots to do them.

I highly encourage you to follow along with the guide and perform the glitches as we show them so you can get the feeling of each.

## **Televator** {#televator}

Televator is one of the glitches [we enabled from QoL](#module-field-toggles) and one of the easiest to perform\! It allows you to instantly teleport you to the top of any elevator in the game.

To perform it: start at the bottom of an elevator; hit it up, hit the lever, wait a bit to hit the lever again, jump in the elevator before it hits the ground and hit the elevator again.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QApichgv\_k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QApichgv_k) 

Once you get the timing right, it’s consistent every time and works in every elevator in the game. You’ll need to hit the elevator again to get it working properly after.  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSWof3XDxCU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSWof3XDxCU)   
There is a version of Televator that works on LP without the need to have QoL, but since we already have the better version of the glitch, I’ll not be covering it.

## **Superslides**

This is another [glitch enabled by QoL](#module-field-toggles). It allows you to store the nail knockback momentum to send you flying at a huge speed. To perform it, you must press pause around the same frame you kill an enemy:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaEbxV7BN0I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaEbxV7BN0I) 

On the base game, this glitch is *frame perfect* but QoL gives you a bigger window to get it. You can also get a bit of height by pressing jump and nail at the same time:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y08p3-mwPc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y08p3-mwPc) 

It’s not only useful for speed. It can enable you to reach checks you normally couldn’t. For example, Acid Bridge:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CChpNNgvgOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CChpNNgvgOg) 

Just be careful that, while on superslide state, you can’t hit transitions:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUN\_dTyYCgU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUN_dTyYCgU) 

## [**Wall Cling Storage (WCS)**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hqhIKzF90NqUJH0R-D2AMHgYF0jTjVPs?usp=drive_link) {#wall-cling-storage-(wcs)}

WCS is a very polemic and complicated glitch, [enabled by QoL](#module-field-toggles). So much so that it has a whole document dedicated to it in HKSR discord. It consists in getting close enough to a wall to get the wall cling state, but far enough that getting away from the wall will not take that away.

It has various uses, especially maintaining dash speed in NMG, but for us it’s main application is that, while on the wall cling state, we can wall jump in the air far away from a wall. We have two consistent ways of getting WCS.

The first consists in hugging a wall, slashing it and canceling the knockback by opening your inventory:  
\[1wcs-nail.mp4\]

The second is by hugging a wall, slashing it and then tapping the direction to the wall just enough to get close to it:  
\[2wcs-walk.mp4\]

Watching it with hitboxes helps getting a better understanding of what is happening:  
\[3wcs-hitbox.mp4\]

You can also keep WCS through a dash to reach places you couldn’t otherwise:  
\[4wcs-fcore.mp4\]

## [**Quick Map Storage (QMS)**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pYTFSXNS6_Z4RhEDqEMP3PeqtTIsa7tq?usp=drive_link)  {#quick-map-storage-(qms)}

Storage is the last glitch [empowered by QoL](#module-field-toggles) we have so far, but it’s the most important glitch as it enables… most of the glitches we’ll see from now on. Storage brings back the fact that when you close your map, it gives you back control of the Knight. For example, you can use that to give you control during screams:  
\[qms-scream.mp4\]

We can exploit this in many different ways, and most of them will involve doing this either with something that already gives us control back or interrupting something that shouldn’t be interrupted.

A good example of the first, and our next glitch, is called [Menu Storage](#menu-storage).

## [**Menu Storage**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/134fM1dF_Otvtxacv2Px5ixSKlsKnVEUv?usp=drive_link) {#menu-storage}

Menu Storage abuses the fact that we can [QMS](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pYTFSXNS6_Z4RhEDqEMP3PeqtTIsa7tq) while during things that already gives us back control to keep the inventory open while being able to move. Here’s an example of getting Menu Storage by opening the map during dream nail, cdash and focus:  
\[qms-dn-focus-cdash.mp4\]

With the menu open, we can exploit the fact that closing the map to gives control back to, for example, skip the item pick up animation:  
\[2qms-control.mp4\]

A common way of getting menu storage is called Inventory Storage by quickly pressing *qm+inventory+qm*. That is not possible with QoL quick map.

Menu Storage is what we call a *weak storage* as it doesn’t stop the Knight from doing any of its actions. We’ll talk about *hard storages* in the next section when we talk about [Transition Storage](#transition-storage).

Menu Storage is a key component of other glitches we’ll touch on further

## [**Focus Storage**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EjfwCNm9blBkCTk2Tf5S1Hytrta_9Hch/view?usp=drive_link)

While on [Menu Storage](#menu-storage)  if you start focusing and close the map you’ll be able to heal while moving. It’s a free Shape of Unn:  
\[focus-storage.mp4\]

## [**Transition Storage**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1avrjQsooFrs7e21UZgkSwx2r9PoRb72i?usp=drive_link)  {#transition-storage}

When you open your map after entering a transition (or as soon as you get out of a transition, but before the game gives you back control) you not only get [Menu Storage](#menu-storage) but you get to keep the transition state.

Transition storage is a *hard storage*. You can’t wings, wall cling, cdash, dream nail, interact or slash while with it,  and you have your fall speed permanently uncapped:  
\[1ts-fall.mp4\]

Also, with TS, you can keep normal walking speed instead of swimming speed and, by dashing, sink. Jumping out of water will lose TS:  
\[2ts-swim.mp4\]  
Closing the map, focusing, using a spell or taking damage will remove TS. If you break TS but keep your map open, you get regular [Menu Storage](#menu-storage).

TS is also a key component of other glitches we’ll see soon.

## [**Dash/Walk Storage**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1naOB3sRLG_UQVTF2T7IjQMrY7_toEgCy?usp=drive_link)

When you have [Transition Storage](#transition-storage), opening the pause menu will keep the knight in the movement state that it already is. We can use it to store the dash momentum:  
\[dash-storage\]

You can also store the walking state, if your hands need a beak:  
\[walkin-storage\]

In case you miss it, the game will take your control and you won’t be able to move. To get it back just close the map:  
\[standing storage\]

## [**Interaction Storage**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a66fTQKrD5LDMEeTdFHawrO1inTrfiuw?usp=drive_link) {#interaction-storage}

You can use [Menu Storage](#menu-storage) to move while interacting with stag or talking to an NPC:  
\[1is-1.mp4\] 

The best use case of it is to skip flower quest:  
\[2is-flower.mp4\]

## [**Bench Float**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1R2dxMXQ7AQmoXAX3iwh5XAoNuuxrwae3?usp=drive_link) {#bench-float}

With [Transition Storage](#transition-storage), interacting with a bench will put you in a weird state that you can move while sitting on the bench. Jumping will give and maintain your height and you can jump multiple times. Use that to access :

CG2 from CG1  
\[1bf-cg2.mp4\]

King’s Pass from Dirtmouth  
\[2bs-kp.mp4\]

Get baited into basin simple claw   
\[3bf-basin.mp4\]

Closing the map while pressing a direction will not stop the movement, you also get one last jump after.

You will always want to close your map and spam left/right to leave the bench before entering a transition otherwise you’ll get [Bench Storage](#bench-storage).

## **Bench Storage** {#bench-storage}

Bench storage is an extremely powerful glitch that is very effectively used in most lp glitched categories. Even though it’s a fantastic glitch, we will want to avoid it most of the time because it stops pretty much every other map related glitch besides [TS](#transition-storage).

I’ll cover the basics of it for informational purposes but do not feel the need to follow this along as it’s something you’ll want to avoid.

Bench storage abuses the fact entering a transition while in the *benched* state will let you keep that state and open your inventory to take control away from your character in moments you normally shouldn’t like transitions.

You can get it by either getting [Bench Float](#bench-float) and entering a transition or with [Interaction Storage](#interaction-storage) to cancel your bench animation

Opening your inventory at any point will take your control. Taking damage will give it back

Opening it during a transition will get you [Transition Storage](#transition-storage)

Opening while exiting a transition takes out of bounds

While your menu is open, you can equip and unequip charms. Equipping charms will heal you

## [**Storage Out of Bounds (SOOB)**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14uRIBZZBdGh1fuAgH8zGa6no2zpiZLFr?usp=drive_link) {#storage-out-of-bounds-(soob)}

This is possibly the most important glitch in glitched rando as it lets us reach transitions we normally couldn’t by going out of bounds.

By closing the map as you exit a transition you take back control from the entering animation before the game puts you in bounds, from there you can reach a transition that is below you by falling into it out of bounds:  
\[1soob-legeater.mp4\]  
This glitch is extremely load dependent and each room will have a different timing to it. Larger rooms will have a bigger window while smaller rooms will have a tighter window. You can use that to access:

Itemless fungal:  
\[2soob-fungal.mp4\]

Hive without tram pass:  
\[3soob-hive.mp4\]

Waterways from Bretta:  
\[4soob-waterways.mp4\]

Quick way to Nosk:  
\[5soob-nosk.mp4\]

If you fail to hit the transition out of bounds, the game will warp you to your last hazard respawn point when you hit \-130y:  
\[5soob-nosk.mp4\]

## [**Hazard Warps**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cQAzCRUkoVKwIjX5OWZ54B-YH3UNiPQF?usp=drive_link)

Contrary to sideways and downwards transitions that update your hazard respawn position pretty much as you enter a room, upwards transitions only update your position when you first hit the ground. We can exploit that by [soobing](#storage-out-of-bounds-\(soob\)) to interrupt the animation and fall oob until hitting \-130y when the game will warp us to the hazard respawn point of the last room.

Here's the classic example, Stagnest from KP:  
\[1hw-stagnest.mp4\]

Timing can be a little tricky at first so practicing with hitboxes on will give you a better notion to it:  
\[2hw-stagnest-hitboxes.mp4\]

It’s also worth noting that the hazard respawn point going into a transition is different from the one going in, back and in again. If you instantly hw from KP to stagnest you’ll get stuck:  
\[3hw-stagnest-wall.mp4\]

You can also chain hazard warps. Here we take the hazard respawn point from Quirrel’s bench room all the way to storerooms:  
\[4hw-chain.mp4\]

Hazard Warps are also time sensitive. For the last example to work you cannot fall with your inventory open otherwise your respawn point will be set to the bottom left corner.  
\[5hw-fall-fail.mp4\]

Falling with your inventory open will also instantly reset your iframes to hazards, so you if respawn inside a hazard you will be warped to the start  
\[6hz-invul-fail.mp4\]

For some forsaken reason only known to Team Cherry themselves, rooms that were split (specially in city) still retain their old hitboxes and will stop you from falling to the warping point  
\[7hz-invul.mp4\]

## [**VS Knockback Storage**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KHHMUybNT6Re61ToCSGh54ATbkiDQ_jE?usp=drive_link) {#vs-knockback-storage}

By opening the map during the VS casting animation you can store the knockback for as long as your inventory is opened. Closing the menu will give you [Slow Fall](#slow-fall) and reopening will restore the knockback storage but it will not keep the height.  
\[vs-knockback.mp4\]

## [**Slow Fall**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wQAI9Ga4WM9k29WrRnYDU_3tImUJDy0n?usp=drive_link) {#slow-fall}

By interrupting an animation the moment you get held in the air, you can keep a weird state that keeps you falling pretty slowly.   
\[1slowfall1.mp4\]

Slow falls can be characterized as soft or hard slow falls. Soft slow falls are obtained from Great Slash (by closing the map when it spawns) or by closing map during [VS Knockback Storage](#vs-knockback-storage) and can be lost with turnarounds.

Hard slow falls are get by:

* Closing map while casting Dive when you are not on the ground  
* By pressing *qm+vs+qm* and walking **forward**. Walking backwards will give you [Float](#float-and-pfloat)  
* Closing map while Dash Slashing


Hard slow falls can only be lost by getting hit, dream nailing or entering a transition

Use Slow Fall to cross big gaps without dash or cdash:  
\[2slowfall2.mp4\]

## [**Dive Float**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OxEUuJiUetlPoCtb84XVLmTxMNdCoP2M?usp=drive_link)

By placing the dive input in the middle of your quick map opening inputs (*qm+dive+qm* in rapid succession) you can be kept permanently in the antic state and, effectively, gain infinite height and keeping your soul.  
\[1divefloat.mp4\]

Dive float is a hard state, it blocks you from casting spells. It can be stopped by hitting a transition or  taking damage  
\[2divefloat.mp4\]

It can also be overridden by [Slow Fall](#slow-fall), and when you hit the ground, you can lose it by dream nailing:  
\[3divefloat.mp4\]

Getting a pickup with Dive Float \+ Soft Slow Fall will soft lock you and you will be forced to *alt+f4* losing all your unsaved progress. To get pickups either dream nail before or get Hard Slow Fall:  
\[4divefloat.mp4\]  
\[5divefloat.mp4\]

Mashing cyclone while on dive float can help you get around some tricky geometry:  
\[6divefloat.mp4\]

You can do a surprising amount of Crystal Peak with Dive and it’s a good practice. Other funny uses I’d like to include are:

Dive only Bretta:  
\[7divefloat.mp4\]

Paum Relic  
\[8divefloat.mp4\]

## [**Dive Walkout**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19qmYdM-9d-RJZTLxHKcxYrEgq3MYOYOx?usp=drive_link) {#dive-walkout}

You can get permanently stuck floating in the walk in animation from a transition by entering it in a dive state. To perform it, get [Menu Storage](#menu-storage), start a dive/ddark and as soon as your character hits the ground, close the map to gain control and enter a transition. Use map to gain control back after.

The best ~~and only so far~~ use for it’s to access Flukewarm without swim:  
\[1divewalkout.mp4\]

## [**DDark Invul**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hDVZTgPX6LbueZrXLA3DXNhmH7xaLHNa?usp=drive_link)

DDark Invul allows you to maintain the DDark iframes for longer than was intended. To perform it: get [Menu Storage](#menu-storage), start a DDark and close the map as soon as your character hits the ground:

DDark Invul is a *weak storage* and can be lost by pick ups, turnarounds, spells or taking damage from hazards.

Entering a sideways transition with DDark Invul will give you [Dive Walkout](#dive-walkout)

As far as my tests go, it only works with ddark.  
\[1ddarkinvul.mp4\]

## [**Dive Storage**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H4f6skFao_OvA1an6M6lkQnhiEz-Z7Pf?usp=drive_link)

You can keep the diving state by casting dive into water/acid/hazard. It’s useful when you want to break a dive floor from below:  
\[1divestorage.mp4\]

Or you want to stop midway while diving:  
\[2divestorage.mp4\]

## **Airwalk and Airwalk Jumps** {#airwalk-and-airwalk-jumps}

I’m only including this here because it’s important for other glitches, otherwise I’m convinced this glitch isn’t real and it can’t hurt me.

Airwalk is a particular state that, similar to [wcs](#wall-cling-storage-\(wcs\)), tricks the game into thinking you are on the ground when you clearly aren’t, getting all the benefits of being on the ground. Dashing will grant you another dash back and you get a whole frame at the end to get a full jump that you can chain infinitely (again, frame perfect). 

There used to have many ways of getting airwalk on previous patches, but the only remaining one is called *wiggle airwalk* or *corner airwalk* and works by abusing corner correction while wiggling in the edge of a platform.

I’ve never performed it; I refuse to believe it’s real, but Rosie sent me this video as evidence in case you need it too:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQhslLyRnFk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQhslLyRnFk) 

## [**Rocket Jumps**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ocm2rczb9mdWC41HHxXIhwwqaEU1N5dU?usp=drive_link)

Rocket jumps have two very different meanings pre 1.3 and post 1.3, but, for the sake of consistency, we’ll only address post 1.3

LP Rocket jumps, essentially, abuses cdash storage to gain airwalk and do an airwalk jump. To perform it, close your map while charging cdash to gain control. After that, release cdash while holding a direction until you get the airwalk and jump:

\[1rc.mp4\]

A couple things to keep in mind:

* The best way to know you got airwalk is by walking off a platform and seeing if you keep the walking animation  
* You’ll also be able hear the knight’s steps it if you get airwalk  
* You can change direction while on cdash storage as long as it’s not recent and bruscal change  
* Stopping, turning around abruptly, getting hit or pressing both direction keys will stop the cdash.  
* The airwalk jump timing is just a bit early then a full wings jump


\[2rc.mp4\]

You can chain as many jumps as you want to as long as you get the timing right (or you can just mash and pray)  
\[3rc.mp4\]

## [**Delayed Interaction**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/109-XAAC77GiFeMvI-TgGbrSsHV9cUQfr?usp=drive_link)

If you stand on the edge of the interaction range of an object you can store the interaction prompt by canceling with the nail animation while stepping away, and then interact with it outside of its range.

You can store dialogues, door entrances and even store multiple interactions at the same time. But the most interesting case happens when you delay a bench interaction. Delay interacting with a bench will warp you to its x position while maintaining your y.

To perform DIS need to slash, interact and press the opposite direction at the same time. You’ll know you got it if you can still see the interact prompt far away from the object.

The most used case is to enter Shade Soul without Elegant key:  
\[1dis.mp4\]

This glitch is physics frame perfect and it’s the reason I play at 60 fps.

## [**Float and Pfloat**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yNopqULB-AYyO6mjMBzRQPQCqtIu2jMq?usp=drive_link) {#float-and-pfloat}

Float is a state in which the knight is unaffected by gravity while p-float (permanent float) is just the name for a float that can be kept between transitions. To perform it:

* Press *qm+vs+qm* in rapid succession (nothing should happen)  
* Close the map and walk to the direction opposite that the knight is facing, the fireball should shoot  
* You are now in a pre float state and need to be taken out of it to get into the float state (you also have no jump height). You can do that by either getting hit, entering a transition or benchwarping

\[1float.mp4\]

While on float:

* Your jump have infinite height, as long as you hold jump you’ll go up (same thing for wings)  
* Sliding on slopes will give you slow fall  
* Cast VS to leave the float state

You can also use corner correction to get [Airwalk](#airwalk-and-airwalk-jumps). While on airwalk+float you can jump and dash infinitely but can’t dash downwards. You can lose the airwalk, in the case you want to lose height by pressing dream nail, focus or cdash.  
\[2float.mp4\]

Float persists through bench warp but not quit outs:  
   
\[3float.mp4\]

While falling, you can stop mid air by opening your inventory. Use this for acid/swim skips:

\[4float.mp4\]

## [**Itemless Sheo Egg**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M1WEe5B4oboiT4KaV8e8w2GS5J5u8W2Y?usp=drive_link)

This is a super specific application of Hazard Out Of Bounds (Hoob), a glitch that I don't touch on in this document, but I wanted to include it anyway. As far as we know, this is the only place this works

Go to the room before Sheo, go back and [Soob](#storage-out-of-bounds-\(soob\)) until you get the hazard respawn. After you respawn, count your knight blinking 4-5 times and go back into the transition. You should hit a hazard and be teleported to the other side of the room:

\[1sheohoob.mp4\]

## [**Dream Gate Invulnerability**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1he89xiA6m0vsakhCgElAhNzm0WB0ndWN?usp=drive_link) {#dream-gate-invulnerability}

When you dream gate, the game gives you invulnerability on the last frames of you leaving the old scene and on the first frames you get spawned in the new one. We can keep that state by interrupting either.

To perform it on the teleport, get [Menu Storage](#menu-storage) start a dream gate and close the menu, wait for the beam to disappear and perform any action (walk, dash, enter a transition, etc…) that it’s not standing still:

\[1invul.mp4\]

DGate Invul grants you immunity to all types of damage, all types of hazard and screams (for some reason). You can do A LOT of fun stuff with that, have fun cheating\!

To get it from spawning, open and close your map at the end of spawning animation:

\[2invul.mp4\]

If you are too early, you can get [Dream Gate No Clip](#dream-gate-no-clip).  
DGate Invul got from spawn will white scream when you use dream gate again or exit a dream.

Dgate No clip is the weirdest and most broken state your knight can be in. It’s a weird mix of [float](#float-and-pfloat), [invul](#dream-gate-invulnerability) and ignoring collisions. To perform it you need to cancel the dream gate arrival state pretty much as soon as you spawn. If you are too late you’ll get [Dream Gate Invul](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1he89xiA6m0vsakhCgElAhNzm0WB0ndWN) instead. I’ll show you two ways of doing that:

First one is: Get [TS](#transition-storage), enter water/acid and dash to sink to the button. After that use a spell to break TS, place a dream gate at the bottom and dream gate out. As soon as you feel like you are warped to the room hold jump and congrats\! You are floating, flying weeee\!

The other one is by mashing [QMS](#quick-map-storage-\(qms\)) to interrupt the arrival animation:

The first one is 100% consistent while the second one is **extremely** load dependent and inconsistent, slower loads are better.

Bench warping gets rid of no clip, but keeps invul:

Noclip movement is extremely expressive and deep in so many ways that I’ll not be able to cover here. Luckily for us, the wonderful runner BlossomTheCellist made an i[n depth guide to noclip movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycoPpfP7nxQ&list=PL7dXvvR7OhcqYGjpJteZhZn-smJ7PZxxE&index=2) that I cannnot recommend enough. I highly encourage you to check them out.

Still, I’ll give you the basics:

* Same rules as float, but you don’t automatically stop on walls. You need to either cast a spell, great/dash slash, pogo or open inventory to stop  
* You can get airwalk inside walls  
* You **cannot** go to upwards transitions. This will softlock you and get you wandering in space forever. (or until you alt+f4)  
* Dashing down (Dash+Dashmaster) is the most reliable way you'll have of losing height. The other is by going through a downwards transition

Right now, Dupes and Main Menu storage don’t have any use in rando. If you find something out, please let us know\!
